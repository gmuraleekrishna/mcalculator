# Karma test runner skeleton

Example how to set up javascript tests.

It supports vanilla javascript testing, jQuery DOM and ajax requests testing.
It will not wait for ajax request responses. This should be tested with functional 
tests. But you can check if right post data would be sent to server.

## Install & run

    npm install -g karma
    karma start
